I've never met Mary Ellen Phillips, but thru Instagram, I discovered her. Mary Ellen is a Registered Dietition Nutritionist who was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes at age 5. Her husband has celiac disease (and she has two small children) so if you got o her site, you'll find a trasure trove of delicious, nutritious recipes.

Although she has Type 1 Diabetes, the vast majority of her advice extends to people with Type 2 Prediabetes and anyone who wants to live a healthier life. She has links to her social media on her website.
